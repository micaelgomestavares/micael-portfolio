    "about-description": "Hello! My name is Micael Gomes, I'm a fullstack software developer passionate about technology and challenges. My programming journey began as a self-taught learner at age 12, which helped me develop a creative and proactive approach to problem-solving. I have professional experience with frontend development at Dinheirow, where I work with React, TypeScript and modern web technologies. I also have experience with networking from my time at IFF (Instituto Federal Fluminense) and years of backend freelancing. As a naturally extroverted person, I love working in teams, sharing ideas and constantly looking for ways to create a collaborative and productive environment. I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.",
